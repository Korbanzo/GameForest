Game Forest is a hub for all your games! As of right now, you need to add the path to the .exe of all your games. Game Forest saves only the name of the game, and path to that game in a .json file, created upon first input of a valid path to a .exe.

TO USE
Download the executable,
Run the executable,
Start adding games!

I wrote everything, except for the .gitignore and styling of the windows where ChatGPT helped me out.
